# Fletcher AWS F1 platform support

Before running any other command, source `sourceme.sh`. This will do everything
needed to set up the AWS SDK and HDK. It will also clone the subrepos if you
haven't already.

After that, you'll probably want to build and install the hardware and/or
cosimulation runtime library in the `runtime` directory. This allows you to use
the `aws` and `aws_sim` Fletcher platforms.

In order to run synthesis and get started quickly with host application
development, you can use the `project-generate.sh` script. Given a VHDL
directory generated by Fletchgen, it'll generate everything you need to get
started. The skeleton project includes a readme file with further information.
